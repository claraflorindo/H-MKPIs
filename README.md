# H-MKPIs

This code is a Streamlit app that connects to an external MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, fetches data from three different tables (customers, articles, and transactions) using API calls.


Once the app is running, use the filters on the sidebar to filter the data and see the results of the four KPIs.

The KPIs displayed are:

What has each customer spent? (Bar chart)
How many purchases has each customer made? (Bar chart)
Total earnings per colour (Bar chart)
Total earnings per Club member status (Pie chart)

The app also displays three metrics:
Average amount spent by customers
Average number of purchases for each customer
Max earnings colour: (name of the colour with the highest earnings)
